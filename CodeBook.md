#This is the codebook for this project. In it I explain how I arrived at the results, starting from the instructions in the course webpage.

* Step 0:  I downloaded the zip files at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. These I unzipped normally on my laptop. 
* Step 1: In R I set my working directory to"./UCI HAR Dataset" and there read the required files in R. The following dataframes resulted: **act_labels**, **features**, **sub_test**, **Xtest**, **ytest**, **sub_train**, **Xtrain**, **ytrain**. I column-binded the train and test data separately, obtaining dataframes **train** and **test** respectively. Then, I row-binded **train** and **test** dataframes together to obtain my initial dataframe, that I named **my_data**. 
* Step 2: I created (from the **features** dataframe) a vector of column-indices, called *indices*, to denote the columns having "mean()" or "std()" in their name. Then I used *indices* to select only those columns, plus the first and last column denoting subjects and activity respectively. The resulted dataframe was named **my_data_selected**. In this dataframe I have the first column denoting the subjects; I named this column/variable "Volunteer_ID". The last column denotes the activity performed for taking the various measurements; I named this column/variable "Activity_Perfomed". The remaining columns/variables got the names they had in the **features** dataframe.
* Step 3
