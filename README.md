# Final-Project-at-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course
What to find in this repository

In this repository I have uploaded the resulted dataframe after the analysis in R, done according to the requirements in the course webpage. This dataframe is named **final**. I have written this dataframe also in a csv file, named **my_sybmission.csv**, also uploaded in the repository. The anaysis is saved in the R script **run_analysis.R**, that contains all the performed steps, together with comments on what I am doing at each step. The **Codebook.md** is the storytelling version of **run_analysis.R**.
